\chapter{Quick note for reviewers}
As you probably know, Latex likes to screw around. It is now 30 minutes before I have to hand in this report for you to review it, and Latex decided 20 minutes ago to completely destroy all of my citations. The control sequences returns as undefined, and I can't figure out how to fix this. Since I totally did NOT want to remove all citations, the easiest way to force this file to compile was to exchange the cite command to an italic command, meaning that all those weird bibtex references you will see in the text are supposed to look good, but don't.\\
Im sorry for any inconvenience, as I am aware that this makes reading harder. Additionally, my references will not be included in this version of the report. [But, tbh, nobody would have looked at them anyway, right?]\\
Thank you very much, and have "fun" reading this report ;)
